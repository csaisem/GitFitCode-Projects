## Covid Movie Seat Booking

Since we are dealing with Covid-19, lets go ahead and pretend we are able to see some of our favorite movies! Identify 5 movies, that each of you would like to watch, and determine some cost for that movie. The goal is to display the movie choices and seats in a theater to select from so y'all are able to purchase your imaginary tickets!

Like last time we haven't added the HTML, JS, or CSS files. We would like y'all to do this yourself :)  **PLEASE** do not look for solutions online! This is only hurting yourself and the rest of the team. Please use the README.md file to describe the code so other developers know how everything works and maybe some points on future goals.

## Project Specifications

- Display UI with movie select, screen, seats, legend & seat info
- Legend: Display information below the in a sentence similar to how y'all displayed the alert. In this case, we want to see this value updating as seats are selected. The Legend should read like the following:
  * You have selected 2 seats for a price of $24!
- User can select a movie/price
- User can select/deselect seats
- User can not select occupied seats
- Number of seats and price will update
- Save seats, movie and price to local storage so that UI is still populated on refresh

Design inspiration from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/3628370-Movie-Seat-Booking)

- start with squares until you have the rest of the features implemented.

Tips:

- Layout the seats in HTML, similar to the design.
- Look up how to use
  * document.querySelectorAll
  * document.querySelector
  * document.getElementById
  * classList.add() (You should be pointing to some div)
  * addEventListener()
- Use JSON.stringify() to parse data from local storage
- When using selects or buttons, use addEventLister()
- Spend some time reading documentation together! [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp)
- Support each other! Make sure that y'all really breakdown these problems into manageable parts that you can solve. It is a lot easier to solve a bunch of tiny problems vs a large one.

- Make sure to use proper styling and to comment your code! Please tab 2, can be set by default!

- Remember this is a team effort! Encourage each other, and really make sure to support each other.

- Before solving any problem, really breakdown all the rules. Maybe even play a couple games so you can easily describe it.

- For team projects it is more than just assigning the work to one another. You each have a set of abilities that bring forth
value to the team you are on. Utilize each other and even assign specific features to help move the project along. We encourage everyone to remember that no matter how tedious the task may be it is still coding.

- Feel free to contact @GitFitDev or @Sirrele for assistance! I hope y'all have fun doing this together!

- You all will kill it! Lets GIT FIT COOOOOOOOODE!!!
